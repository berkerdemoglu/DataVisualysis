Long Term Plan for the Project:
- All functions for analyzing data.
- The ability to visualize data using matplotlib with a little touches from me.
- Deploy the module using pip (Learn how that works).


Plan for August 12, 2020:
- Create a module for dataset functions (dataset_functions.py).
- Study data visualization from PCCB.
- Add more statistical functions for calculator.py.
- Use the unittest module for testing DataModeler.
- Find a good name for the project (DataModeler or DataVisualysis?).
- Write functions for writing to files (dataset_functions.py).
- Add a function for printing how many files are in json_files.
- Learn how project development levels are named.
- Organize the functions and basically the whole project. Find ways to make the code faster.
