===========================

Run the executable file, 'dv-setup-windows.exe'.
Alternatively, you can run 'dv-al-setup-instructions.bat'.

The files are completely harmless, they only contain commands to install required
modules for the program. If you get a message from your anti-virus program warning
you that the file that you're downloading may be harmful, you can safely ignore it.
