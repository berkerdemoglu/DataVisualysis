# Â© DataVisualysis 0.2.1

A Python project for analyzing and visualizing data.

The file you want to run is 'data_main.py'. A DataVisualysis object is generated in 'data_main.py' and one can run some methods for analysis.

The data visualization part is still lacking, but it will be implemented using matplotlib.
The GUI is still lacking, but it will be implemented using Tkinter.

# Required Python Modules:
- matplotlib
- requests
- json (built-in module)
- random (built-in module)

## Thank you...
