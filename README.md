# Â© DataVisualysis 0.1.3.1

A Python project for analyzing and visualizing data.

The file you want to run is 'data_program.py'. A DataVisualysis object is generated in 'data_program.py' and one can run some methods for analysis.

The data visualization part is still lacking, but it will be implemented using matplotlib.

# Required Python Modules:
- matplotlib
- requests
- json (built-in module)
- random (built-in module)
