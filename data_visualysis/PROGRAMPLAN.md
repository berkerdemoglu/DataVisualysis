## :heavy_exclamation_mark: *DO NOT FORGET TO* :heavy_exclamation_mark::
>- Check files for sensitive info such as an API key.
>- Make sure data_program.py just consists of instantiating a DataVisualysis object.
>- Change development process (e.g 0.1.2 -> 0.1.3)


## INCOMPLETE TASKS:
>- Write a proper file for testing DataVisualysis using the unittest module.
>- Add ability to take info from SQL.
>- Learn how uploading packages to pip works.
>- Learn how github command line works.
>- Implement some functions from Excel.
>- Add ability to generate a dataset with a specified standard deviation, median etc.


### Long Term Plan for the Project:
>- All functions for analyzing data.
>- The ability to visualize data using matplotlib with a little touches from me.
>- Deploy the module using pip.
>- Create a website for the project.


### Plan for August 12, 2020:
>- Create a module for dataset functions (dataset_functions.py). ✓
>- Study data visualization from PCCB. X
>- Add more statistical functions for calculator.py. X
>- Use the unittest module for testing DataModeler. INCOMPLETE
>- Find a good name for the project (DataModeler or DataVisualysis?). ✓
>- Write functions for writing to files (dataset_functions.py). INCOMPLETE
>- Organize the functions and basically the whole project. ✓


### Plan for August 13, 2020:
>- Add an option to change the default directory (used when a data set or a file path is not provided). ✓
>- data_modeler.py -> data_visualysis.py ✓
>- Study data visualization from PCCB. ✓
>- data_app.py -> data_program.py ✓
>- Add ability to get more than 10000 numbers from random.org ✓
>- Learn how github command line works. X
>- Add more statistical functions for calculator.py. ✓
>- Use the new API key and make sure the old one is deactivated. ✓


### Plan for August 14, 2020:
>- OFF DAY
>- Learned some C++


### Plan for August 15, 2020:
>- Learned some C++ ✓
>- Implemented requesting more than 10000 numbers from random.org,
>but API key requires more bits. DISCONTINUED
>- Revise Security.MD. ✓
>- PROGRAMPLAN.txt -> PROGRAMPLAN.md ✓


### Plan for August 16, 2020:
>- Study data visualization from PCCB. X
>- Add ability to generate a dataset with a specified standard deviation, median etc. NOT STARTED
>- Add ability to return dataset or store dataset (generate dataset) ✓
>- Implement some functions from Excel. NOT STARTED
>- Study some MySQL from that 5 hour-long video. DISCONTINUED
>- Add ability to take info from SQL. NOT STARTED
>- Revise the default directory thing (You can accidentally overwrite a stored file). DISCONTINUED


### Plan for August 17, 2020:
>- Study data visualization from PCCB. X
>- Load the DataVisualysis logo. ✓
>- Study some C++ from that 4-hour long video. ✓
>- Write the compare_datasets() function in data_visualysis.py
>- Revise the methods of the DataVisualysis class.
>- Revise the parameter names of all functions and methods.
>- Revise data_modeler_exceptions. ✓
>- Rename files to match the project's name, DataVisualysis. ✓
>- See if you need class methods. DISCONTINUED
>- Add comments.
>- Look for some duplicate code, slowing down the program.
>- See if you need to refactor some things.
>- Revise the check_directory() function. DISCONTINUED
>- Download the code and save it in the python_projects folder. ✓
